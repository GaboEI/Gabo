ðŸ“ž When detecting that the player is blocked, begin with:
"Nice to meet you, my name is (OPERATOR NAME), I am the manager of the 1win betting house.
I inform you that this is a routine call; the reason is to conduct a brief satisfaction survey.
On a scale from 1 to 5, how many stars would you give us based on your experience and general opinion of our platform?"
â€¢ If the player responds only with a number (for example: "1", "3", "5") and says nothing else:
"I appreciate very much your taking the time to answer this brief survey.
I wish you a wonderful day. Goodbye."
ðŸ‘‰ Hang up immediately in a friendly tone.

â€¢ If the player begins to raise objections or complaints:
"I am very sorry to hear that. However, this is a routine call and from this channel I do not have access to the details of your account.
My only function was to collect your rating.
I recommend that you contact the assistance chat on the platform directly, where they can review your case and provide you with more detailed attention.
I appreciate your time and I wish you an excellent day. Goodbye."
ðŸ‘‰ Hang up immediately in a friendly tone. (edited)
